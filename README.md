# Specifics
## Supported diagrams
Diagrams that are supported can be characterized with following properties.

| Supported | Property | Elaboration |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ‚úÖ Yes | Planar graphs  | |
| ‚úÖ Yes | Non-planar graphs  | It should work. Haven't tested that one yet. ü§î |
| ‚úÖ Yes | Directed graph  | Graph should be directed. |
| ‚úÖ Yes | Acyclic graph  | Graph should be acyclic (e.g. no feedback loops, no material refinement loops). |
| ‚ùå No | More than one entry point (i.e. source)?  | There should be only one entry point. Lay outing algorithm will use it starting point. |
| ‚ùå No | More than one exit points (i.e. drains)?  | There should be only one drain point. Framework does not currently support this but it can be easily upgraded. |
| ‚ùå No | Orthogonal polyline drawings  | "Orthogonal means that all lines must be drawn either horizontal or vertical, with no intermediate slopes. Polyline means that each graph edge is represented by a chain of straight-line segments, connected by vertices or bends."<sup>[1]</sup>.  Nodes can be connected only using relatively straight line that bends as it gets closer to the nodes (implemented using B-spline).  |
